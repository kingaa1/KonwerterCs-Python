# C# to Python Converter

## Project Description

This project is a simplified converter that transforms code from **C#** to **Python**, implemented in **Python**. The **ANTLR4** parser generator is used for syntax handling. The application includes a graphical user interface (GUI) to simplify the usage of the converter. The final version of the project can be found in the **`NewVer`** folder.

## Features

- **Code Conversion from C# to Python**  
  Automatically transforms C# syntax into Python syntax.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**  
  A user-friendly interface to facilitate using the tool without the need for command-line interaction.

- **Syntax Handling with ANTLR4**  
  Utilizes the ANTLR4 parser generator for precise parsing of C# code syntax.

---

## Technologies

- **Python**  
  The primary programming language used for the implementation of the converter.

- **ANTLR4**  
  A parser generator for analyzing the syntax of the source code.

- **Tkinter/PyQt !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**  
  (or any other GUI framework used in the project) – for building the graphical user interface.
